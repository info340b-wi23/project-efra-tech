        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The main users for this application are family members. This app intends to strengthen
            the connection and communication between family members in today's digitalized age, by
            bringing their digitalized interactions on this app back into a closely-functioning
            household. We are envisioning an average American family where people tend to get
            busy enough that kids forget to do their chores, or keep up with family time and events,
            so this platform intends to hold information that helps make every family member's life
            a little easier, so to say. In consideration to minorital groups, this app could either
            have a really beneficial impact by providing a way for everyone to see the family's
            plan for a given week without having to worry about language barriers (such as how
            some immigrant parents struggle to effectively communicate with their American-born
            children). This app can also have a huge impact on the live's of homemaking mothers
            or fathers, because they may be able to find more time for themselves using an app like this
            since the household expectations won't all be put on one person.

            That being said, this app intends to minimize the amount "reminding" that
            parents need to facilitate in real life, by putting it all in one app instead. For example,
            when the trash needs to be taken out, everyone in the family will know who's turn it is
            because it will be written a to-do list within this app, a feature meant to keep chores and other
            household-maintenance tasks in order. Another feature will include a calender where family
            members can mark timings for different events, such as family game night or the youngest
            child's soccer match, or breakfast at Grandma's. The calender will be a static component upon the
            page, but users can add blocks onto it depending on what type of event it is, and from what time.
            One thing our team wants to experiment with is giving users the ability to integrate the to-do list
            within the calender so that they can view it alongside everything else, as well as separately in list form.
            The last feature our team wants to include is a page consisting of different subsections where family's can keep
            track of images from different holidays or events, similar to a Google Folders sort of format.
