        <h2>Problem Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            In this current era, with the increased use of phones and social media, it has become apparent 
            that people have been allocating less time for their families. Doing this has led to people feeling 
            disconnected, which could be detrimental for their mental health. This has led to the question, 
            “How can we facilitate better connection between family members?”. One information problem that 
            comes up when thinking about this question is the fact that people cannot read other's minds, so it 
            becomes crucial to find a way to spread information between family members.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The main users for this application are family members. This app intends to strengthen
            the connection and communication between family members in today's digitalized age, by
            bringing their digitalized interactions on this app back into a closely-functioning
            household. We are envisioning an average American family where people tend to get
            busy enough that kids forget to do their chores, or keep up with family time and events,
            so this platform intends to hold information that helps make every family member's life
            a little easier, so to say. In consideration to minorital groups, this app could either
            have a really beneficial impact by providing a way for everyone to see the family's
            plan for a given week without having to worry about language barriers (such as how
            some immigrant parents struggle to effectively communicate with their American-born
            children). This app can also have a huge impact on the live's of homemaking mothers
            or fathers, because they may be able to find more time for themselves using an app like this
            since the household expectations won't all be put on one person. Lastly in terms of
            potential impact, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebekahbastian/2021/08/11/why-social-media-can-be-more-toxic-for-marginalized-identities/?sh=6001cb852d77">studies</a>
            show that many mariginalized communities get negatively impacted from misrepresentation or
            toxicity online, so an app dedicated to family-orientation could in turn have a positive
            impact with helping people feel more at home.
        </p>
        <p>
            That being said, this app intends to minimize the amount "reminding" that
            parents need to facilitate in real life, by putting it all in one app instead through these features:
            <ol>
                <li>For example,
                    when the trash needs to be taken out, everyone in the family will know who's turn it is
                    because it will be written a to-do list within this app, a feature meant to keep chores and other
                    household-maintenance tasks in order. </li>
                <li>Another feature will include a calender where family members can mark timings for different events, 
                    such as family game night or the youngest child's soccer match, or breakfast at Grandma's. </li>
                <li>The calendar will be a static component upon the
                    page, but users can add blocks onto it depending on what type of event it is, and from what time. </li>
                <li>The last feature our team wants to include is a page consisting of different subsections where family's can keep
                    track of images or family recipes from different holidays or events, similar to a Google Folders sort of format,
                    but more stylish.</li>
            </ol>
            One thing our team also wants to experiment with is giving users the ability to integrate the to-do list
                    within the calender so that they can view it alongside all other events, as well as separately in to-do list form.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user will be viewing information added by themselves and other family members. This information can take various formats. For instance the information can take form of pictures that a member uploads to the family photo album or different dish recipes hat are commonly prepared in the household. We are not using any external API for fetching information or any real-time data. As mentioned before, the motivation behind creating this app to improve the bond and communication within the family. We believe that features such as a todo-list will assist members in understanding daily routine and requirements of others, a digital image album will enable parents to capture their child's journey and cherish the important moments.
